# Barnsley Resort Bidirectional Staff ↔ Management Communication Chatbot

### Goal

Create a psychologically safe, structured communication layer that:

* Helps staff express real operational issues clearly
* Translates feedback into business outcomes leadership cares about
* Surfaces trends early
* Improves guest experience, retention, and efficiency

---

## 1. Core Problems Being Solved

### Staff Pain

* Not informed about private events → awkward guest interactions
* Bar / space availability unclear
* No safe way to raise concerns or ideas
* Feedback ignored or misunderstood

### Management Pain

* Operational friction appears as guest dissatisfaction
* Feedback is emotional, vague, or anecdotal
* No quantified impact → hard to prioritize
* Problems discovered only after reviews or revenue impact

---

## 2. Chatbot Primary Functions

### A. Staff Input Flow (Guided Conversation)

Bot walks employee through structured discovery:

1. **Situation**

   * What happened?
   * Where/when?
   * Who was affected?

2. **Impact**

   * Guest experience
   * Staff workflow
   * Time lost / confusion / stress

3. **Underlying Need**

   * Information missing?
   * Timing?
   * Tools?
   * Staffing?
   * Policy clarity?

4. **Facts vs Interpretation**

   * Observations separated from opinions
   * Evidence captured

5. **Suggestion**

   * What would have prevented this?

➡ Output: Clear NVC-style statement automatically generated

| “We apologize constantly”        | Brand perception damage  |
